# HibernateORM
This is a web application using Hibernate's object relational mapping for customized database operations and queries.

## IDE 
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. 
For more insight, download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Tomcat server
The entire web application is wrapped inside a `Tomcat server`. Visit here for the official [documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/).

## MySQL Server
Apache servers of `XAMPP` are used for this along with `PhpMyAdmin`. Visit [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) for more information.

## MySQL Connector
You can use *any* lanuage actually. But to connect it to your MySQL Databse you need to load the Driver (in this case: `com.mysql.cj.mysql.Driver` package, where the Driver class is located.) by downloading the Connector JAR file 
[here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

## Hibernate
Usually MySQL or any database is used to store your data. Hibernate is a framework which supports ORM, that is object relational mapping. This 
allows a class (Entity class) or an XML file (hib.xml) to actually map to your database tables. After that you can use it's own functions rather than writing queries for *any* database.
